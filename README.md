🏦 Home Loan Analytics Dashboard — Power BI Project

### 📊 Overview

This project analyzes a Home Loan dataset to uncover insights into loan applications, disbursements, recovery trends, and channel performance. The dashboard was developed using Power BI to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions regarding loan management and customer engagement.

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Financial institutions often process thousands of home loan applications through multiple branches and channels. However, tracking loan performance, disbursement efficiency, and recovery trends can be difficult without a unified analytics view.
This project aims to:

Identify trends in loan applications and disbursements.

Analyze loan recovery efficiency.

Understand channel and branch performance.

Enable interactive Q&A and AI-driven exploration of business data.

### 🎯 Tasks Performed

Imported and cleaned the Home Loan dataset in Power BI.

Built interactive dashboards to visualize loan performance metrics.

Designed measures using DAX for:

Total Loan Amount

Total Applied Loan Amount

Total Disbursed Amount

Total Recovery Amount

Created cards and visuals to summarize key metrics.

### Developed visuals including:

💰 Loan Amount Funnel — showing the flow from applied to disbursed to recovered loans.

📈 Applied Loan Amount Trend — highlighting trends over time.

🏦 Branch Distribution — identifying top-performing branches.

🔄 Channel Distribution & Top Channel Analysis — revealing which channels drive most applications.

🤖 Q&A & AI Visuals — enabling natural language interaction for quick insights.

Published and shared the dashboard using Power BI Service for interactive exploration.


### 🔍 Key Insights

Loan Application Volume showed steady growth over time, indicating rising customer interest.

Disbursement-to-Application Ratio helped identify process efficiency across branches.

Top Channels (e.g., Online, Partner Agents) contributed significantly to total loan disbursement.

Branch-level Analysis revealed geographical trends and performance disparities.

Recovery Amount Trends helped assess financial risk and repayment performance.
